**Great Features** 
- Flutter Secure Storage provides API to store data in secure storage. Keychain is used in iOS, KeyStore based solution is used in Android.
- If the platform is Android, then flutter_secure_storage stores data in encryptedSharedPreference, which are shared preferences that encrypt keys and values. It handles AES encryption to generate a secret key encrypted with RSA and stored in KeyStore.
  For the iOS platform, flutter_secure_storage uses the KeyChain which is an iOS-specific secure storage used to store and access cryptographic keys only in your app.
  In the case of the web, flutter_secure_storage uses the Web Cryptography (Web Crypto) API.

**Problems from Videos** 
- Question: I use flutter secure storage in flutter web, token was save in local storage browser but when I changed token in local storage browser ,token changed. Why my account can not log out when token was change?
  Answer: you need to write some logic for your requirement to be fulfilled. you have to logout on token change and make sure remove all user data from local while logout
- Question: Any reason you put the key in a variable?  Usually when you access an array you just write the key each time and storing it as a variable doesn't help much?  Just curious of the reason as it doesn't really matter if it is personal preference or something.
  Answer: Maybe because its using the same key in different places and if you want to change it you would need to change it in all different places
- Question: Hi, can i use tgist storage to store and encrypt pdfs or midi files?
  Answer:  Hey go with hive database. It provides a feature for securing filesðŸš€
- Question: We can also use the authStateChange if the current user is logged in or not right?
  Answer: Yeah

## 3. Video Structure

**Main Points / Purpose Of Lesson**

1. It uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to storing data securely and encrypted. It read, write, and delete data from secure storage.
2. Main points of this video lesson
    - First is using firebase auto login
    - Second is flutter_secure_storage official example on github.
3. It is the best plugin to save data securely. We can use it to save the login credentials of a user to prevent from repeatedly login.

**The Structured Main Content**
1. Run `dart pub add flutter_secure_storage` to add this package to your project pubspec.yaml file.
2. Main Points
    - Configure Android version in `[project]/android/app/build.gradle` set `minSdkVersion` to >= 18.
    - You can configure web, linux, windows and MacOS by visiting (pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage)[https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage]
    - For login purpose, I use firebase. So run `dart pub add firebase_core` and `dart pub add firebase_auth` in terminal to add these dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` file.
3. For auto login using firebase, first configure and integrate your project with firebase and then make four screens login, signup, profile after login and forgot_password.
    - In `login.dart` initialize storage.
    ```dart
      final _storage = new FlutterSecureStorage();
    ```
    - This is the `userLogin()` method where I added `storage.write(key: "uid", value: userCredential.user?.uid)`.
    ```dart
    userLogin() async {
    try {
      UserCredential userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance
          .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email: email, password: password);
      // print(userCredential.user?.uid);
      await _storage.write(key: "uid", value: userCredential.user?.uid);
      Navigator.pushReplacement(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => const Profile(),
        ),
      );
    } on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
      if (e.code == 'user-not-found') {
        print("No User Found for that Email");
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          const SnackBar(
            backgroundColor: Colors.orangeAccent,
            content: Text(
              "No User Found for that Email",
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0, color: Colors.black),
            ),
          ),
        );
      } else if (e.code == 'wrong-password') {
        print("Wrong Password Provided by User");
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          const SnackBar(
            backgroundColor: Colors.orangeAccent,
            content: Text(
              "Wrong Password Provided by User",
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0, color: Colors.black),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
     }
    }
    ```
    - In `main.dart` file, I added a boolean method `checkLoginStatus()` like this:
    ```dart
      Future<bool> checkLoginStatus() async {
    String? value = await _storage.read(key: "uid");
    if (value == null) {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
   }
    ```
4. In `secure_storage_official.dart` intialize flutter secure storage.
   ```dart
   final _storage = const FlutterSecureStorage();
   ```
Then run this project by replacing `home: FutureBuilder(...)` property of `MaterialApp` in `main.dart` with `home: SecureStorageOfficial(),` which is also commented in `main.dart` file.
