**Great Features**

- "flutter_secure_storage" package is commonly used in Flutter applications to securely store
  sensitive information such as authentication tokens, API keys, and other confidential data. It
  provides a key-value store with encryption support.
- One of the main features is the ability to store data securely by encrypting it. This helps
  protect sensitive information from being easily accessed if someone gains unauthorized access to
  the device.

## 3. Video Structure

**Main Points / Purpose Of Lesson**

1. Login and SignIn UI
2. Firebase Integration using CLI
3. Remember Me checkbox to save user detail like uid from firebase, email, and password via flutter
   secure storage

**The Structured Main Content**

1. Inside `main.dart` file, we are using FutureBuilder to initialize Firebase and avoid exceptions.
2. For the home parameter, we are calling `CheckStatus` class. Inside it, we are again using
   FutureBuilder to return `SignInPage` or `ProfilePage`.
    - If the saved uid is null, then return `SignInPage` otherwise return `ProfilePage`.
3. Inside sign in page.dart file, onPressed parameter of signIn button.
    - Inside it, we are checking if the form is valid then call signInUser method.
    - We are using a try catch block to sign the user in.
    - We are calling signInWithEmailAndPassword method of firebase and passing the texts of email
      and password to it.
    - If the sign in is successful then navigate to `ProfilePage`.
4. After hot restart, if i click on sign in button as a registered user then see here it navigates
   to the ProfilePage.
    - Next, for remember me checkbox, we want to implement the remember functionality via flutter
      secure storage.
    - If the checkbox is checked then email, password, and userId should be saved.
    - We will use uid to automatically login the user.
    - And we will also save email and password to pre-fill the text fields.
5. So, let’s create rememberMe boolean flag.
    - Then inside checkbox, set the value to rememberMe and for onChanged parameter, we are saving
      the new value in the rememberMe boolean flag when it is checked or unchecked
    - Now, inside sign in user method, we are checking if rememberMe is true then store the uid,
      email, and password of the user via flutter secure storage plugin.
    - Additionally, we need to see if the user saved their details.
    - If they did, let's fetch their email and password using Flutter Secure Storage.
    - If they're available, we'll automatically fill in the email and password fields.
    - Therefore, let’s create getUserDetail method.
    - We are reading uid, email, and password via flutter secure storage.
    - If they are not null then assign email and password to the text of their controllers.
    - And then call this method inside initState.

6. Inside profile page, we want to delete the userId stored in flutter secure storage when user
   clicks on the log out icon.
